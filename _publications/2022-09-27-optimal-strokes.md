collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'This paper is about the optimal swimming strokes of a specific swimmer configuration, the 4-sphere swimmer, at low Reynolds numbers, e.g. at microscopic scale. The mathematical structure of the optimal swimming stroke for any small displacement are worked out in the paper.'
